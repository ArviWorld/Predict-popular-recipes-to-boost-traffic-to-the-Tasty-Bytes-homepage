# Predicting Recipe for Taste Bytes Homepage\
This project applies advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques to support homepage recipe selection for Tasty Bytes. Models are developed to predict which recipes are likely to generate high website traffic, based on recipe category, nutrient composition, and serving size. Insights from these analyses guide the platform in optimizing homepage selections to maximize user engagement and subscription growth.

**Acknowledgement**\
I sincerely thank my parents and family for their unwavering support and
encouragement, which enabled me to dedicate my time and effort to
learning Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and applying them
to environmental management challenges. I thank the Google Career
Certification and Datacamp Certification courses for providing me the
comprehensive resources and guidance to enhance my skills in Python, R
Programming, and Machine Learning Concepts.

**Use of generative artificial intelligence**\
Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools were primarily used to
assist in creating visualization, refining charts, and adjusting
plotting parameters. In addition, GenAI was used for helping me write,
debug code and improve workflow efficiency. All outputs generated by
GenAI were carefully reviewed, modified and evaluated before
implementation to ensure scientific accuracy, reliability, and alignment
with the research objectives.

**Ethical Consideration and Transparency**\
This research was conducted with transparency, rigor, and ethical
responsibility. All computational methods and analyses were
independently validated, and any use of automated or AI-assisted tools
was fully disclosed. The methodologies and code are provided to ensure
reproducibility and facilitate future research.

**Data and Code Availability**\
Where applicable, datasets, code scripts, and analysis workflows used in
this research are openly available upon request or in public
repositories, supporting transparency and reproducibility in
computational environmental management research.

# Executive Summary {#executive-summary .unnumbered}

**Problem Statement**\
Recipe displays on the Tasty Bytes homepage are chosen subjectively,
leading to inconsistent customer engagement and low traffic to the
website. When a popular recipe is displayed, overall site traffic
increases by up to 40%, assuming that it drives more subscriptions.
However, the team lacks a systematic way to predict which recipes will
generate high traffic.

**Project Aim and Focus**\
The aim of the project is to develop a data-driven prediction systems
that identifies which recipes will lead to high homepage traffic. The
focus is on achieving at least 80% accuracy in correctly predicting
high-traffic recipes, thereby supporting subscription growth and
improving user engagement.

**Raw data used**\
The project uses a dataset (`recipe_site_traffic_2212.csv`) which
includes variables such as, recipe, nutrient contributions and servings
for the recipe, recipe category, website traffic for the recipe.

**Methodology**\
The project applies classification machine learning models to predict
popular recipes for increasing customer engagement and thereby
subscriptions. Key steps include:

-   Data Exploration and Preprocessing
-   Feature Analysis and Selection
-   Model Selection, Development and Training
-   Model Evaluation and Training
-   Deployment
-   Iteration & Monitoring

This project demonstrates how data-driven approaches can provide
actionable insights to Tasty Bytes, enabling smarter recipe selection
and promoting customer engagement and subscriptions.

**Results/Key Findings:**

-   **Recipe category drives traffic:** Vegetables and Potato recipes
    consistently attract high traffic, while Beverages, Breakfast, and
    Chicken generally see lower engagement.
-   **Nutrients and servings have secondary impact:** Protein content
    shows modest influence; calories, carbohydrates, sugar, and serving
    size are less predictive.
-   **Model performance:** Logistic Regression achieved the highest
    ROC-AUC (0.801), while Random Forest and XGBoost provide robust,
    balanced predictions. Decision Tree offers interpretable insights
    but slightly lower predictive power.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Focus on high-traffic categories** (Vegetables, Potato) in recipe
    development and promotion.
2.  **Use ensemble models** (Random Forest/XGBoost) to predict recipe
    popularity and guide recommendations.
3.  **Enhance engagement for lower-traffic categories** through
    innovative recipes, nutritional highlights, or combined promotions.
4.  **Leverage protein and other nutrient information** to personalize
    recommendations for health-conscious users.
5.  **Optimize marketing and UX strategies** based on predicted traffic
    to increase recipe visibility and user engagement.

**Next Steps:**

-   Integrate predictive models into the Tasty Bytes platform for
    real-time traffic estimation.
-   Monitor model performance regularly and retrain with new traffic
    data.
-   Explore additional features (ratings, seasonality, prep time) to
    improve predictions.
-   Conduct A/B testing to validate category-driven promotion
    strategies.
-   Develop campaigns to boost engagement for under performing
    categories.
-   **Impact:** By focusing on predictive insights, Tasty Bytes can
    maximize user engagement, optimize content strategy, and make
    data-driven decisions for recipe promotion.
